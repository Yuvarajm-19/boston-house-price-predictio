📊 **Boston House Price Prediction**  

This project predicts Boston house prices using linear regression with the **LSTAT** feature. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation using **MAE**, **MSE**, and **RMSE** metrics. Future improvements include using more features, applying advanced models, and optimizing performance for better accuracy.

## 📝 **Results**  
The model shows a negative correlation between **LSTAT** and house prices, indicating that higher LSTAT values result in lower prices. Visualizations validate the regression line’s fit.

---

## 💡 **Future Improvements**  
- Incorporate multiple features for multivariate regression  
- Apply advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Conduct hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering
